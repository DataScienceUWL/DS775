{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"06b958","input":"## Question 18 <font color=\"magenta\"> (10 points, manual)</font>\n\nOxbridge University maintains a powerful mainframe computer\n  for research use by its faculty, Ph.D. students, and research\n  associates. During all working hours, an operator must be available\n  to operate and maintain the computer, as well as to perform some\n  programming services. Beryl Ingram, the director of the computer\n  facility, oversees the operation.\n\n  It is now the beginning of the\n  fall semester, and Beryl is confronted with the problem of assigning\n  different working hours to her operators. Because all the operators\n  are currently enrolled in the university, they are available to work\n  only a limited number of hours\n  each day, as shown in the following table:\n  \n  <img src=\"images/operator_availability.png\" width=\"800\">\n  \n  There are six operators (four undergraduate students and two\n  graduate students). They all have different wage rates because of\n  differences in their experience with computers and in their pro-\n  gramming ability. The above table shows their wage rates, along with\n  the maximum number of hours that each can work each day.  \n\n  Each\n  operator is guaranteed a certain minimum number of hours per week\n  that will maintain an adequate knowledge of the operation. This\n  level is set arbitrarily at 8 hours per week for the undergraduate\n  students (K. C., D. H., H. B., and S. C.) and 7 hours per week for\n  the graduate students (K. S. and N. K.).\n\n  The computer facility is to be open for operation from 8 A.M. to 10\n  P.M. Monday through Friday with exactly one operator on duty during\n  these hours. On Saturdays and Sundays, the computer is to be\n  operated by other staff.  Because of a tight budget, Beryl has to\n  minimize cost. She wishes to determine the number of hours she\n  should assign to each operator on each day.\n\n  Use Pyomo to solve this problem. Your solution should include all necessary code and inputs, and it should produce formatted output. Note: be sure to use real variables, but your answers will work out to be integers.\n  \n  **Note:** If you want to see more examples for this kind of problem, you could review the beginning of Lesson 3 about \"Transportation Problems\".  The kind of code we write in Lesson 3 is more abstract and generalizable than the code in this lesson, but we'll get into that next week.  To think about this as a transportation problem think of the \"operators\" as the suppliers.  Each operator supplies hours of labor.  The demanders are the days of the week.  Each day of the week has a demand of exactly 14 hours of labor.  The companies job is to figure out how much labor to \"transport\" from each operator to each day of the week subject to the number of hours the operator is available on that day.  Transportation problems are introduced in the textbook in Chapter 9 beginning on page 318.","pos":27,"type":"cell"}
