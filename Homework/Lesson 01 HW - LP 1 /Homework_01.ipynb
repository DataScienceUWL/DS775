    "  **Note:** If you want to see more examples for this kind of problem, you could review the beginning of Lesson 3 about \"Transportation Problems\".  The kind of code we write in Lesson 3 is more abstract and generalizable than the code in this lesson, but we'll get into that next week.  To think about this as a transportation problem think of the \"operators\" as the suppliers.  Each operator supplies hours of labor.  The demanders are the days of the week.  Each day of the week has a demand of exactly 14 hours of labor.  The companies job is to figure out how much labor to \"transport\" from each operator to each day of the week subject to the number of hours the operator is available on that day.  Transportation problems are introduced in the textbook in Chapter 9 beginning on page 318."
