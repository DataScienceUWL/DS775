{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"374411","input":"## Questions 3-10  (use this setup for 3-10)\n\nGiapetto's Woodcarving, Inc., manufactures two types of wooden toys: soldiers and trains.\n\nA soldier sells for \\$27 and uses \\$10 worth of raw materials. Each soldier that is manufactured increases Giapetto’s variable labor and overhead costs by \\$14 (so think about what the unit profit would be). A train sells for \\$21 and uses \\$9 worth of raw materials. Each train built increases Giapetto’s variable labor and overhead costs by \\$10. The manufacture of wooden soldiers and trains requires two types of skilled labor: carpentry and finishing. A soldier requires 2 hours of finishing labor and 1 hour of carpentry labor. A train requires 1 hour of finishing labor and 1 hour of carpentry labor. Each week, Giapetto can obtain all the needed raw material but only 80 carpentry hours and 100 finishing hours. Demand for trains ($y$) is unlimited, but at most 40 soldiers ($x$) are bought each week. Giapetto wants to maximize weekly profit (revenues-costs). (This example is from the textbook \"Operations Research\" by Wayne L. Winston.)\n\nThe model formulation that can be used to maximize Giapetto’s weekly profit is:\n\nMaximize $Z = 3x + 2y,$ \n\nsubject to \n\n$\n\\begin{array}{rcrcr}\nx & + & y & \\leq & 80 \\\\\n2x & + & y & \\leq & 100 \\\\\n x        &         &  & \\leq & 40 \n\\end{array}\n$\n\nand $x \\geq 0, y\\geq 0.$\n\nUse <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/24c3qe4hl5\">this Desmos page</a> or create your own Desmos graph to answer the questions below. Note, if it's tricky to adjust a slider in Desmos you can click on number and edit it directly.\n\n\n### Question 3 <font color=\"magenta\">(1 point, auto)</font>\n\nWhat is the shadow price for the weekly carpentry hours?\n\n### Question 4 <font color=\"magenta\">(1 point, manual)</font>\n\nWrite a sentence describing the shadow price for the weekly carpentry hours in the context of the problem.  (e.g. for Wyndor:  For each additional hour of production time at plant 3 the maximum total profit increases by 1 thousand dollars if the weekly carpenter hours is in its allowable range.)\n\n### Question 5 <font color=\"magenta\">(1 point, auto)</font>\n\nWhat is the lower bound for the allowable range of weekly carpenter hours?\n\n### Question 6 <font color=\"magenta\">(1 point, auto)</font>\n\nWhat is the upper bound for the allowable range of weekly carpenter hours?\n\n### Question 7 <font color=\"magenta\">(2 points, auto)</font>\n\nIf the demand for soldiers is reduced enough, then the demand becomes a sensitive parameter.  If everything else stays the same as in the original problem, at what demand level does demand become a sensitive parameter?\n\n### Question 8 <font color=\"magenta\">(2 points, auto)</font>\n\nIf everything else stayed the same but the price of selling a soldier increased to \\$28.50, then what is the new maximum profit (in dollars)?\n\n### Question 9 <font color=\"magenta\">(1 point, auto)</font>\n\nIf everything else stayed the same but the price of selling a soldier increased to \\$28.50, then how many soldiers should be produced to achieve the maximum profit?\n\n### Question 10 <font color=\"magenta\">(1 point, auto)</font>\n\nIf everything else stayed the same but the price of selling a soldier increased to \\$28.50, then what is the new shadow price for weekly carpenter hours?","pos":8,"type":"cell"}

Since pigs will eat any mix of these feed types, the objective is to determine which mix will meet certain nutritional requirements at a minimum cost.

However, it is not clear just how many more\nshould be hired. Management recognizes the need for cost control while also consistently\nproviding a satisfactory level of service to customers. Therefore, an OR team is studying\nhow to schedule the agents to provide satisfactory service with the smallest personnel cost.\n\nBased on the new schedule of flights, an analysis has been made of the minimum number\nof customer service agents that need to be on duty at different times of the day to provide a satisfactory level of service. The rightmost column of the table below shows the number\nof agents needed for the time periods given in the first column. The other entries in this\ntable reflect one of the provisions in the company’s current contract with the union that\nrepresents the customer service agents. The provision is that each agent work one of the five different available 8-hour shifts 5 days per week.  Each agent keeps the same shift for the week (no switching shifts between days).\n\nCheckmarks in the main body of the table show the hours covered by the respective\nshifts. Because some shifts are less desirable than others, the wages specified in the contract\ndiffer by shift. For each shift, the daily compensation (including benefits) for each\nagent is shown in the bottom row. The problem is to determine how many agents should be\nassigned to the respective shifts each day to minimize the total personnel cost for agents,\nbased on this bottom row, while meeting (or surpassing) the service requirements given in\nthe rightmost column.\n\n<img src=\"images/problem5p5.png\" width=\"640\"> ","pos":19,"type":"cell"}
