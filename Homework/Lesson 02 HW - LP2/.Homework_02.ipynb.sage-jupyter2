Your data and model should be completely separated so that none of the parameters are typed directly into the model.  You should use dictionaries to store the coefficients and right-sides of constraints.  The problem setup is included again below for convenience.\n\nOxbridge University maintains a powerful mainframe computer\n  for research use by its faculty, Ph.D. students, and research\n  associates. During all working hours, an operator must be available\n  to operate and maintain the computer, as well as to perform some\n  programming services. Beryl Ingram, the director of the computer\n  facility, oversees the operation.  \n\n  It is now the beginning of the\n  fall semester, and Beryl is confronted with the problem of assigning\n  different working hours to her operators. Because all the operators\n  are currently enrolled in the university, they are available to work\n  only a limited number of hours\n  each day, as shown in the following table: \n  \n  <img src=\"images/operator_availability.png\" width=\"800\">\n  \n  There are six operators (four undergraduate students and two\n  graduate students). They all have different wage rates because of\n  differences in their experience with computers and in their pro-\n  gramming ability. The above table shows their wage rates, along with\n  the maximum number of hours that each can work each day.  \n\n  Each\n  operator is guaranteed a certain minimum number of hours per week\n  that will maintain an adequate knowledge of the operation. This\n  level is set arbitrarily at 8 hours per week for the undergraduate students (K. C., D. H., H. B., and S. C.) and 7 hours per week for the graduate students (K. S. and N. K.).\n\n  The computer facility is to be open for operation from 8 A.M. to 10\n  P.M. Monday through Friday with exactly one operator on duty during\n  these hours. On Saturdays and Sundays, the computer is to be\n  operated by other staff.  Because of a tight budget, Beryl has to\n  minimize cost. She wishes to determine the number of hours she\n  should assign to each operator on each day.\n\n  Because of a tight budget, Beryl has to minimize cost.

Each soldier that is manufactured increases Giapetto’s variable labor and overhead costs by \\$14 (so think about what the unit profit would be). A train sells for \\$21 and uses \\$9 worth of raw materials. Each train built increases Giapetto’s variable labor and overhead costs by \\$10. The manufacture of wooden soldiers and trains requires two types of skilled labor: carpentry and finishing. A soldier requires 2 hours of finishing labor and 1 hour of carpentry labor. A train requires 1 hour of finishing labor and 1 hour of carpentry labor. Each week, Giapetto can obtain all the needed raw material but only 80 carpentry hours and 100 finishing hours. Demand for trains ($y$) is unlimited, but at most 40 soldiers ($x$) are bought each week. Giapetto wants to maximize weekly profit (revenues-costs). (This example is from the textbook \"Operations Research\" by Wayne L. Winston.)\n\nThe model formulation that can be used to maximize Giapetto’s weekly profit is:\n\nMaximize $Z = 3x + 2y,$ \n\nsubject to \n\n$\n\\begin{array}{rcrcr}\nx & + & y & \\leq & 80 \\\\\n2x & + & y & \\leq & 100 \\\\\n x        &         &  & \\leq & 40 \n\\end{array}\n$\n\nand $x \\geq 0, y\\geq 0.$\n\nUse <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/24c3qe4hl5\">this Desmos page</a> or create your own Desmos graph to answer the questions below.

The rightmost column of the table below shows the number\nof agents needed for the time periods given in the first column. The other entries in this\ntable reflect one of the provisions in the company’s current contract with the union that\nrepresents the customer service agents. The provision is that each agent work one of the five different available 8-hour shifts 5 days per week.  Each agent keeps the same shift for the week (no switching shifts between days).\n\nCheckmarks in the main body of the table show the hours covered by the respective\nshifts.
