    "This problem is related to the self-assessment question in the lesson titled \"Unbalanced Transportation Problem\" and is modeled after a problem found in Practical Management Science by Wayne L. Winston and S. Christian Albright.  \n",

    "International Textile Company, Ltd, Kong–based firm that distributes textiles world- wide. They have mills for weaving bolts of cotton fabric in the Bahamas, Hong Kong, Korea, Nigeria, and Venezuela.  The mills ship bolts of cotton to distribution eight distribution centers (listed below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The company is owned by the Lao family. Present plans are to remain in Hong Kong through the transition in governments. Should the People’s Republic of China continue its economic renaissance, the company hopes to use its current base to expand operations to the mainland. International Textile has mills in the Bahamas, Hong Kong, Korea, Nigeria, and Venezuela, each weaving fabrics out of two or more raw fibers: cotton, polyester, and/or silk. The mills service eight company distribution centers.  Cotton supplies and demands at the distribution center are shown below.  Shipping costs depend on both distances and other factors and are in the cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the company is switching to a different shipping method with a limit of 500 cotton bolts on each route.  Moreover, shipments from Venezuala to the United States will no longer be possible (no shipments to Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York).\n",

    "This transportation problem is unbalanced.  Write Pyomo code to find the minimum shipping cost.  Solve the problem without introducing any dummy mills or distribution centers.  Include your complete, abstract, Pyomo code in the cell below and in your CoCalc notebook.  Your code should output a data frame that displays the shipping amounts.

    "Each of three warehouses has two products, pA and pB, in stock to send to five different warehouses.  Each route from a warehouse to a store has a limited capacity of 700 products (total of pA and pB) or there is no shipping available on that route.  The per unit shipping cost on each route doesn't depend on the product.  For example, it costs $14/unit to ship product pA or pB from warehouse wA to store sA.  Supply, demand, costs, and capacities, are loaded into data frames below for your convenience.  To access values in the data frame:  `cost.loc['wA','sC']` gives 12.\n",
