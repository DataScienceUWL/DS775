    "Warren Buffy is an enormously wealthy investor who has built his fortune through his legendary investing acumen. He currently has been offered three major investments and he would like to choose one. The first one is a conservative investment that would perform very well in an improving economy and only suffer a small loss in a worsening economy. The second is a speculative investment that would perform extremely well in an improving economy but would do very badly in a worsening economy. The third is a counter- cyclical investment that would lose some money in an improving economy but would perform well in a worsening economy.\n",

He is pessimistic about where the economy is headed, and so has assigned prior probabilities of 0.1, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively, to these three scenarios. He also estimates that his profits under these respective scenarios are those given by the following table:\n",

Past experience indicates that $p$ for an entire lot is either 0.05 or 0.25. Furthermore, in 80 percent of the lots produced, $p$ equals 0.05 (so $p$ equals 0.25 in 20 percent of the lots).

Initially the company can either screen each item in a lot at a cost of \\$10 per item and replace defective items or use the items directly without screening. If the latter action is chosen, the cost of rework is ultimately \\$100 per defective item. Because screening requires scheduling of inspectors and equipment, the decision to screen or not screen must be made 2 days before the screening is to take place.
