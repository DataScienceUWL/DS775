Initially the company can either screen each item in a lot at a cost of \\$10 per item and replace defective items or use the items directly without screening. If the latter action is chosen, the cost of rework is ultimately \\$100 per defective item. Because screening requires scheduling of inspectors and equipment, the decision to screen or not screen must be made 2 days before the screening is to take place. However, one item can be taken from the lot and sent to a laboratory for inspection, and its quality (defective or nondefective) can be reported before the screen/no screen decision must be made.
