{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2100c0","input":"# Problem Set up\n*Note: this information is not included in the Canvas quiz.*\n\nThe file *Airfares.xlsx* contains real data that were collected between Q3-1996 and Q2-1997.  A csv file of the data is also provided (called *Airfares.csv*).\n\nWe're copying the instructions from the presentation file here for ease of use.\n\nThe following problem takes place in the United States in the late 1990s, when many major US cities were facing issues with airport congestion, partly as a result of the 1978 deregulation of airlines. Both fares and routes were freed from regulation, and low-fare carriers such as Southwest (SW) began competing on existing routes and starting non-stop service on routes that previously lacked it.  Building new airports is not generally feasible, but sometimes decommissioned military bases or smaller municipal airports can be reconfigured as regional or larger commercial airports.  There are numerous players and interests involved in the issue (airlines, city, state, and federal authorities, civic groups, the military, airport operators), and an aviation consulting firm is seeking advisory contracts with these players.\n\nA consulting firm wishes to determine the maximum average fare (FARE) as a function of three variables: COUPON, HI, and DISTANCE.  COUPON, HI, and DISTANCE are things that an airline could control, when determining where to locate new routes.\n\nMoreover, they need to impose constraints on \n- the number of passengers on that route (PAX) $\\leq 20000$\n- the starting city’s average personal income (S_INCOME) $\\leq 30000$\n- the ending city’s average personal income (E_INCOME) $\\geq 30000$\n\nFor additional constraints:\n* restrict COUPON to no more than 1.5\n* limit HI to between 4000 and 8000, inclusive\n* consider only routes with DISTANCE between 500 and 1000 miles, inclusive.\n\nHowever, the variables PAX, S_INCOME, and E_INCOME are not decision variables so the firm must first model these variables using COUPON, HI, and DISTANCE as predictors using linear regression (predictive analytics).  They'll also use linear regression to model a linear relation between FARE and COUPON, HI, and DISTANCE.  Armed with these predictive models the firm will build a linear program (prescriptive analytics) to maximize the average fare.\n\nSuppose you are in the aviation consulting firm and you want to maximize airfares for the particular set circumstances described below. The file *Airfares.xlsx* contains real data that were collected between Q3-1996 and Q2-1997. The first sheet contains variable descriptions, while the second sheet contains the data.  A csv file of the data is also provided (called *Airfares.csv*).\n\n*NOTE: This problem scenario is developed from pp. 170-171 in Data Mining for Business Analytics: Concepts, Techniques, and Applications in R, by Shmueli, Bruce, Yahav, Patel, and Lichtendahl, Wiley, 2017)*\n\n## Part 1: The Predictive Models\nSince each of these models uses the same predictors and the only thing that varies is the response variable, write a function that takes in the dataframe, a list of predictors and a response variable string which:\n* runs the linear regression based on the \n* returns the model\n* prints the regression equation.\n\nUse a non-repetitive approach to run multiple linear regression **through the origin** using the average number of coupons (COUPON) for that route, the Herfindel Index (HI), and the distance between the two endpoint airports in miles (DISTANCE) as predictors. You'll build 4 multiple linear regression models, one for each of the following response variables:\n\n- the average fare (FARE)\n- the number of passengers on that route (PAX)\n- the starting city’s average personal income (S_INCOME)\n- the ending city’s average personal income (E_INCOME)\n\nFor each of the models, you'll need to:\n\n* print the resulting linear equation. For instance: $FARE = X_1COUPON + X_2HI + X_3DISTANCE$ with the $X_n$ coefficients filled in.\n* print the $R^2$ for each model. (Hint, it's stored in a variable that can be accessed by calling .rsquared on whatever variable you created when you fit the model.)\n* store the data in such a way that you can use the coefficients directly in the linear program.\n\nTo solve this, start by completing the regModel() function below.  Then call the regModel function 4 times to produce the coefficients for each model.  You should store the coefficients in such a way that you can access them easily to build the linear programs that are needed later (we suggest you store all the coefficients in one data structure).  Here is a template for the function\n\n```python\ndef regModel(df, X, Y):\n    \"\"\"\n    find linear regression coefficients for Y ~ X using the data in df\n\n    Parameters:\n    df (pandas data frame): contains the response and predictor variables\n    Y (str): a string matching the column name of the response variable\n    X (list of str): column names of the predictor variables\n\n    Returns:\n    (list of floats or similar): linear regression model coefficients for each predictor variable\n\n   \"\"\"\n   # find model\n   \n   # print output\n   \n   # return coefs\n```\n\nFor example this code:\n\n```python\nairfares = pd.read_csv(\"data/Airfares.csv\")\npredictors = ['COUPON', 'HI', 'DISTANCE']\n\ncoef = regModel( airfares, predictors, 'FARE')\n\nprint('\\nThe coefficients of the regression model are:')\nprint(coef)\n```\n\nWould produce output similar to this:\n\n```\nModel is: FARE = 22.5900 COUPON + 0.0118 HI + 0.0833 DISTANCE (R^2 = 0.91)\n\nThe coefficients of the regression model are:\nCOUPON      22.590019\nHI           0.011798\nDISTANCE     0.083336\n```","pos":3,"type":"cell"}
