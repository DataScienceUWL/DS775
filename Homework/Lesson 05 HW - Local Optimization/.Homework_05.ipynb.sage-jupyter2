Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of $R_1$ units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit (in dollars per hour) of $200 R_1 - 100 R_1^2.$ If the production rate of product 2 is $R_2$ units per hour, its estimated profit (in dollars per hour) would be $300 R_2 - 100 R_2^2.$\n\n### Question 1 <font color=\"magenta\">(8 points, manual)</font>\n\nFormulate a quadratic programming modeland solve it using Pyomo with the ipopt solver.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"21cdc7","input":"The knapsack problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that will be good for practicing with the ideas of discrete local search and multistart.  Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.  In the 0-1 version of the knapsack problem, the decision variables are binary (or boolean) and represent whether or not to include each item in the collection.  We'll start with 20 items and you need to determine the collection of items that maximizes the value and keeps the total weight up to 50 (that is $\\leq 50$).","pos":14,"type":"cell"}
