The Self Assessment problem about the Medequip Company near the end of Lesson 2 is also a transportation problem where diagnostic equipment is supplied to customers who \"demand\" it."

    "It often happens in transportation problems that shipping is not available on along certain routes due to problems or prohibitive costs.  In the previous example the route between cannery 1 and warehouse 4 was infeasible which was handled by setting the maxiumum capacity on that route to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least three approaches to dealing with infeasible routes:\n",

    "1.  Enforce infeasible routes by setting the maximum capacity to be zero on those routes like in the previous example.  To make a route have unlimited capacity simply set the maximum capacity to be a larger value than any amount that will be transported along that route. This approach was demonstrated in the example just above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If there is a mix of only infeasible and unlimited routes then it is possible to \"trick\" the model into making some routes infeasible by setting the cost to be a very large number for the routes that should be infeasible.  This is sometimes called the \"big M\" method where the cost on infeasible routes is set to a very large number M.  We'll show that approach in the next example.  *We describe this method because it's in the textbook, but in practice it's probably best to use one of the other approaches as both are more robust.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Assume that the amounts shipped on infeasible routes are zero and eliminate decision variables for those routes.  This approach may be necessary for very large problems with many infeasible routes (a sparse problem) to reduce the number of decision variables in the solution.  Details of this approach are beyond the scope of our course.\n"
