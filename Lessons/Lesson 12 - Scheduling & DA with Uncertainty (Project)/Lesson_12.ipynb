    "For the final project, we're going to combine concepts from Lesson 3 (Scheduling), Lesson 10 (Simulation), and Lesson 11 (Decision Analysis). We'll do this by revisiting the scheduling problem from Lesson 3. But, we're going to make it a little more true-to-life by acknowledging some of the uncertainty in our estimates, and using simulation to help us come up with better estimates. We'll use our estimated profits to construct a payoff table and make a decision about how to proceed with the building project. We'll introduce more uncertainty around the possible presence of artifacts.\n",

    "In this homework we'll use the <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.triangular.html\">*numpy random triangular*</a> function to draw samples from triangular distributions. The triangular distribution function expects a left, mode (middle), and right number as seeds, and it draws from a continuous distribution between the left and right values, with the middle value being the mode that defines the shape of the triangle. Let's look at a plot of a triangular distribution."
