    "The following problem takes place in the United States in the late 1990s, when many major US cities were facing issues with airport congestion, partly as a result of the 1978 deregulation of airlines. Both fares and routes were freed from regulation, and low-fare carriers such as Southwest (SW) began competing on existing routes and starting non-stop service on routes that previously lacked it.  Building new airports is not generally feasible, but sometimes decommissioned military bases or smaller municipal airports can be reconfigured as regional or larger commercial airports.  There are numerous players and interests involved in the issue (airlines, city, state, and federal authorities, civic groups, the military, airport operators), and an aviation consulting firm is seeking advisory contracts with these players.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A consulting firm wishes to determine the maximum average fare (FARE) as a function of three variables: COUPON, HI, and DISTANCE.  Moreover, they need to impose constraints on \n",
    "- the number of passengers on that route (PAX) $\\leq 20000$\n",
    "- the starting city’s average personal income (S_INCOME) $\\leq 30000$\n",
    "- the ending city’s average personal income (E_INCOME) $\\geq 30000$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the variables PAX, S_INCOME, and E_INCOME are not decision variables so the firm first model these variables using COUPON, HI, and DISTANCE as predictors using linear regression (predictive analytics).  They'll also use linear regression to model a linear relation between FARE and COUPON, HI, and DISTANCE.  Armed with these predictive models the firm will build a linear program (prescriptive analytics) to maximize the average fare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are in the aviation consulting firm and you want to maximize airfares for the particular set circumstances described below. The file *Airfares.xlsx* contains real data that were collected between Q3-1996 and Q2-1997. The first sheet contains variable descriptions while the second sheet contains the data.  A csv file of the data is also provided (called *Airfares.csv*).\n",
