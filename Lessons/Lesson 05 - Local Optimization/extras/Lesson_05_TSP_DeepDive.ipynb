    "# Traveling Salesman Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "In lessons 5 and 6, we cover the traveling salesman problem. We skim over some of the code, because you truly do not need to understand what's happening inside some of the functions in order to be able to use them. But, for those that are curious, let's take a deep dive into the guts of the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete Optimization Big Ideas\n",
    "Before we do that, though, let's touch on the big ideas behind all of our discrete optimization problems. There are few commonalities, and if you understand them, you'll see why you don't need to understand what's happening inside the provided functions. You just need to know the purpose of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea One: Every Problem Starts with an Initial State\n",
    "A \"state\" is just the current value or set of values for your decision variable(s). We often start with a randomly selected state, but not always. In the knapsack problem, the initial state is an empty backpack. For the traveling salesman problem, the initial state is a randomly selected route that goes through each location. For the gerrymandering problem, the initial state is cities randomly assigned to districts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea Two: Every Problem Requires Some Way to Alter the State\n",
    "The whole point of these optimization problems is that we alter the state to find some minimum or maximum value associated with the state. To get there, we need a way to alter the state. For hand-coded local search, this could be a single line of code that \"flips a bit\" (like in the knapsack problem) or a function that alters the state in some way (like the subtour_reversal function in the TSP problem). When we do simulated annealing, this will be the \"move\" function. In genetic algorithms, changing the state is handled by selection, crossover, and mutation. Sometimes we call this \"making a move.\" Sometimes we call this \"perturbing the state.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever we call it, what we're doing is making some **minor** modification to the state, in the hopes that the new state will give us a better result. We want these to be **small moves** so that we find a \"nearby\" state. We don't want to start with a completely random state every time. We're hoping that we're taking steps \"towards\" an optimal state, which is called \"converging\" on the optimal state. If we jump all over the place, it's hard to ever get closer to our goal/converge. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea Three: Every Problem Requires A Way to Measure the State (the Objective Function)\n",
    "So we've changed the state. Now what? Every problem requires some way to measure that state. This is the same as having an objective fuction. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the knapsack problem, we're summing the value of the items in the knapsack. For the traveling salesman problem, we're figuring out the total length of the route. For the gerrymandering problem, we're determining the number of districts that Republicans win. In our hand-coded problem, this is usually some bit of code the result of which is assigned to the variable new_value. In simulated annealing, this is the function called \"energy\" and in genetic algorithms this is called evaluating the fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea Four: SOME Problems Include Constraints\n",
    "For discrete problems, we can use either soft constraints or hard constraints. Detailed information about constraints are covered in the <a href=\"https://github.com/DeannaDS/shared/blob/master/ds775/Lesson_05_Load_Balancing_With_Constraints.ipynb\">Load Balancing with Constraints</a> example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, with that out of the way, let's dive in to the TSP problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "First off, all of the data for this problem is stored in a json file. The json file also handily tells us what the best tour is, so we can start by plotting our best tour. See commented code below.\n"
