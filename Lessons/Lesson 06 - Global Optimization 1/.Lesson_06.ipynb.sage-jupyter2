Must be in the form\n    ``f(x, *args)``, where ``x`` is the argument in the form of a 1-D array\n    and ``args`` is a  tuple of any additional fixed parameters needed to\n    completely specify the function.\nbounds : sequence, shape (n, 2)\n    Bounds for variables.  ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``,\n    defining bounds for the objective function parameter.\nargs : tuple, optional\n    Any additional fixed parameters needed to completely specify the\n    objective function.\nmaxiter : int, optional\n    The maximum number of global search iterations. Default value is 1000.\nlocal_search_options : dict, optional\n    Extra keyword arguments to be passed to the local minimizer\n    (`minimize`). Some important options could be:\n    ``method`` for the minimizer method to use and ``args`` for\n    objective function additional arguments.\ninitial_temp : float, optional\n    The initial temperature, use higher values to facilitates a wider\n    search of the energy landscape, allowing dual_annealing to escape\n    local minima that it is trapped in. Default value is 5230. Range is\n    (0.01, 5.e4].\nrestart_temp_ratio : float, optional\n    During the annealing process, temperature is decreasing, when it\n    reaches ``initial_temp * restart_temp_ratio``, the reannealing process\n    is triggered. Default value of the ratio is 2e-5. Range is (0, 1).\nvisit : float, optional\n    Parameter for visiting distribution. Default value is 2.62. Higher\n    values give the visiting distribution a heavier tail, this makes\n    the algorithm jump to a more distant region. The value range is (0, 3].\naccept : float, optional\n    Parameter for acceptance distribution. It is used to control the\n    probability of acceptance. The lower the acceptance parameter, the\n    smaller the probability of acceptance. Default value is -5.0 with\n    a range (-1e4, -5].\nmaxfun : int, optional\n    Soft limit for the number of objective function calls. If the\n    algorithm is in the middle of a local search, this number will be\n    exceeded, the algorithm will stop just after the local search is\n    done. Default value is 1e7.\nseed : {int, `~numpy.random.RandomState`, `~numpy.random.Generator`}, optional\n    If `seed` is not specified the `~numpy.random.RandomState` singleton is\n    used.\n    If `seed` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance is used, seeded\n    with `seed`.\n    If `seed` is already a ``RandomState`` or ``Generator`` instance, then\n    that instance is used.\n    Specify `seed` for repeatable minimizations. The random numbers\n    generated with this seed only affect the visiting distribution function\n    and new coordinates generation.\nno_local_search : bool, optional\n    If `no_local_search` is set to True, a traditional Generalized\n    Simulated Annealing will be performed with no local search\n    strategy applied.\ncallback : callable, optional\n    A callback function with signature ``callback(x, f, context)``,\n    which will be called for all minima found.\n    ``x`` and ``f`` are the coordinates and function value of the\n    latest minimum found, and ``context`` has value in [0, 1, 2], with the\n    following meaning:\n\n        - 0: minimum detected in the annealing process.\n        - 1: detection occurred in the local search process.\n        - 2: detection done in the dual annealing process.\n\n    If the callback implementation returns True, the algorithm will stop.\nx0 : ndarray, shape(n,), optional\n    Coordinates of a single N-D starting point.\n\nReturns\n-------\nres : OptimizeResult\n    The optimization result represented as a `OptimizeResult` object.\n    Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, ``fun`` the value\n    of the function at the solution, and ``message`` which describes the\n    cause of the termination.\n    See `OptimizeResult` for a description of other attributes.\n\nNotes\n-----\nThis function implements the Dual Annealing optimization. This stochastic\napproach derived from [3]_ combines the generalization of CSA (Classical\nSimulated Annealing) and FSA (Fast Simulated Annealing) [1]_ [2]_ coupled\nto a strategy for applying a local search on accepted locations [4]_.\nAn alternative implementation of this same algorithm is described in [5]_\nand benchmarks are presented in [6]_. This approach introduces an advanced\nmethod to refine the solution found by the generalized annealing\nprocess. This algorithm uses a distorted Cauchy-Lorentz visiting\ndistribution, with its shape controlled by the parameter :math:`q_{v}`\n\n.. math::\n\n    g_{q_{v}}(\\Delta x(t)) \\propto \\frac{ \\\n    \\left[T_{q_{v}}(t) \\right]^{-\\frac{D}{3-q_{v}}}}{ \\\n    \\left[{1+(q_{v}-1)\\frac{(\\Delta x(t))^{2}} { \\\n    \\left[T_{q_{v}}(t)\\right]^{\\frac{2}{3-q_{v}}}}}\\right]^{ \\\n    \\frac{1}{q_{v}-1}+\\frac{D-1}{2}}}\n\nWhere :math:`t` is the artificial time. This visiting distribution is used\nto generate a trial jump distance :math:`\\Delta x(t)` of variable\n:math:`x(t)` under artificial temperature :math:`T_{q_{v}}(t)`.\n\nFrom the starting point, after calling the visiting distribution\nfunction, the acceptance probability is computed as follows:\n\n.. math::\n\n    p_{q_{a}} = \\min{\\{1,\\left[1-(1-q_{a}) \\beta \\Delta E \\right]^{ \\\n    \\frac{1}{1-q_{a}}}\\}}\n\nWhere :math:`q_{a}` is a acceptance parameter. For :math:`q_{a}<1`, zero\nacceptance probability is assigned to the cases where\n\n.. math::\n\n    [1-(1-q_{a}) \\beta \\Delta E] < 0\n\nThe artificial temperature :math:`T_{q_{v}}(t)` is decreased according to\n\n.. math::\n\n    T_{q_{v}}(t) = T_{q_{v}}(1) \\frac{2^{q_{v}-1}-1}{\\left( \\\n    1 + t\\right)^{q_{v}-1}-1}\n\nWhere :math:`q_{v}` is the visiting parameter.\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.2.0\n\nReferences\n----------\n..

Don't worry too much about the exact coding details since we'll ultimately use packages to automate Bayesian Optimization.  Instead, just focus on developing a high-level picture of how Bayesian optimization works.  If you want more details, there are **many** tutorials available with a bit of googling.  <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-beauty-of-bayesian-optimization-explained-in-simple-terms-81f3ee13b10f\">This article</a> gives a high-level view and talks a bit about what makes this optimization approach \"Bayesian\".  The image below illustrates the steps.  It's called \"Bayesian\" because a Bayesian probability framework is used to show how to update the surrogate model to reflect the knowledge gained from the additional sample point.\n\n<img src=\"images/BayesianOptimizationFlowChart.png\" width = \"400\" align=\"center\"/>\n\n<br><br>\n\n#### Define your Objective Function and Evaluate on Initial Sampling Set\n\nThe first step in any optimization problem is determining your objective function. Bayesian optimization requires an objective function in which your variables have bounds (a finite limit on each real or integer number or a defined set of values for categorical variables). \n\nFor illustration we'll work with an objective function that has one input variable.  Suppose we want to minimize\n$$f(\\mathbf{x})=x \\sin(x) + \\epsilon, \\mbox{ for } x \\in [0,10].$$\n\n$\\epsilon$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation $\\sigma$ that represents the theoretical noise level.

To do this we will first construct an acquisition function from the surrogate and then use the acquisition to \"acquire\" the next point.\n\nNext we need what's called an acquisition function. Remember we said that Bayes Optimization learns as it goes. It does that by \"acquiring\" new data points. Each iteration of the algorithm will run the surrogate model and then \"acquire\" the sample point or points that are most likely to improve the overall results. Again, there are many ways to do approach determining what the best new points are. Three common approaches are:\n\n* Probability of Improvement (PI).\n* Expected Improvement (EI).\n* Lower Confidence Bound (LCB).\n\nWe'll demonstrate by building the LCB acquisition function.  The surrogate model returns both the approximate function value as $\\mu(x)$ and the expected variability, the standard deviation, as $\\sigma(x)$.  The formula for the LCB is\n$$a(x) = \\mu(x) - \\kappa \\sigma(x).$$ Essentially, the LCB is found by looking $\\kappa$ standard deviations below the surrogate function values.

Use it to approximate the location of the global minimum for the \"Bumpy\" function above.  You'll notice that you will usually get close to the location of the global minimum at the origin, but it won't be exact because it is very difficult to randomly move exactly to the minimum location.  Typically, for continuous functions, simulated annealing is combined with local search in an iterative procedure (we'll see an example of this in the homework with the `dual_annealing` optimizer from the `scipy.optimize` package.  For this example you could take the best state found by simulated annealing and use it to start a local search using `minimize` from `scipy.optimize` package.\n\nThe code from the TSP example above is a good starting point.  Instead of the distance matrix you'll need to pass the scale parameter sigma to determine the size of the moves.  A good starting point for sigma is range/6 where range = upper bound - lower bound.  This value for sigma is because a normal distribution is about 6 * sigma wide.  You may want to experiment with the value of sigma to see how it affects the result of simulated annealing.  You could also play with the time allowed when you set the schedule for the annealing.\n\n### Dual_Annealing from scipy.optimize\n\nSimulated annealing works with both continuous and discrete variables.

However, for many problems the search space is too large and/or the function landscape is too complicated to guarantee that the best solution can be found.\n\nA metaheuristic algorithm attempts to find a good solution without any guarantee of being able to find the best solution.  Often metaheuristics are stochastic in nature, that is they incorporate randomness as an element of the search, but they aren't generally completely random in nature.  They incorporate search patterns which are known to work well for the problem at hand.\n\nMetaheuristic algorithms try to find a compromise somewhere between randomly searching the search space and local search.  People speak of the **exploration and exploitation tradeoff**.  Exploration ensures the algorithm reaches different promising regions of the search space, whereas exploitation ensures the searching of optimal solutions within the given region.  The trick is in finding the right balance. Go too far into exploitation and the algorithm gets stuck in local extrema, go too far to exploration and the algorithm will waste time on solutions that are less likely to be good and ignore the information already gathered.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no single algorithm which works best for all classes of problems.

The big advantage of Bayesian Optimization is that it learns as it goes, and does so more efficiently than just repeatedly solving whatever your objective function is. It does this by using a surrogate function that's generally much less expensive to evaluate than the objective function is, and using the results of that surrogate function to update the sample data and zero in on the optimal solution.  Bayesian Optimization is useful when:\n* the objective function is very expensive to evaluate\n* the dimensionality of the problem (the number of input variables) is not too large, e.g. $\\leq 20$\n* the derivative of the objective function is unknown or unavailable (the derivate is a function which reveals the slope of the function)\n* you are seeking a global minimum instead of a local minimum.\n* the objective function may include noise so that the function does not return the same value every time it is evaluated\n\nWe will see that Bayesian Optimization gets used for Hyperparameter Optimization of machine learning models.  Machine learning models can be expensive to evaluate and because they often work with random subsets of the training data they may not produce the same results on every evaluation.\n\n### Bayesian Walkthrough Video 1\n\nIn this video we talk through the main ideas in Bayesian Optimization and we go through the notebook sections below \"Steps in Bayesian Optimization\" through \"Putting it Together by Iterating\".

In a strict hill-climbing algorithm we only allow uphill moves, but in simulated move we sometimes allow downhill moves and are more likely to allow downhill moves in the early part of the search.  The idea is that to find the tallest peak in a mountain range we have to first descend from a lower peak.\n\nThe probability of a downhill move is determined by a temperature parameter that decreases throughout the search.  The probability of a downhill move depends on the size of the downhill move compared to the temperature.  At high temperatures large and small downhill moves are probable, but as the temperature decreases only small downhill moves are probable so that the search performs similarly to a local search at low temperatures\n\nIn simulated annealing algorithm high temperature promotes exploration (global search) while low temperature promote exploitation (local search).  As the algorithm proceeds, the temperature decreases and transitions from exploration to exploitation.\n\nHere is pseudocode for **Simulated Annealing:**\n```\n set starting state and initial temperature\n while local_condition \n     select a move \n     if acceptable \n         do the move \n         if new optimum or random # < probability determined by temperature\n             remember it\n     decrease temperature\n endwhile \n ```\n \nChoosing the initial temperature and the manner in which the temperature decreases are critical to the performance of simulated annealing.  We'll start with a temperature schedule that looks like this:\n$$ T = T_0 \\alpha^n.$$\nWhere $T_0$ is the initial temperature, $0 < \\alpha < 1,$ and $n$ is the number of iterations.   This is called geometric temperature decay, but many other choices are possible.  However, there aren't really rules for how to choose $T_0$ and $\\alpha$.  Usually we'll choose $T_0$ to be similar to the size of the function to be optimized when it is evaluated at random points and $\\alpha$ should be close to $1$ like $\\alpha = 0.99$.  You may have to experiment with the values of these parameters to achieve good results.  The simanneal package introduced below includes some automatic tuning of the temperature schedule that seems to work well for many problems, but it can be much slower than setting a fixed schedule for some problems.\n\nIn the next section we'll demonstrate simulated annealing using our own code for the traveling salesman problem, but in general we'll use the `simanneal` package that will be introduced further below.","metadata":{"hidden":true},"pos":5,"type":"cell"}
