    "Whenever you're doing machine learning with a classification model, you need to be aware of imbalanced data. Imbalanced data is data where the majority of the response (y) values in your data fall into one class. In the data you were given for the project, we'd artificially balanced the data - giving you roughly equal good and bad loans. In real life, there would be far more good loans than bad loans, far more real credit card transactions than fraudulent ones, far more negative cancer tests than positive ones, etc. Classification problems are often looking for that proverbial \"needle in the haystack.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that if we're using accuracy as our metric with imbalanced data, the classifier can always guess the majority class, and we'll have pretty decent accuracy. For example, the data that we're using in this example is survey data from the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The purpose of the classifier is to predict opioid users, which account for just 6% of the survey respondents. If the classifier predicted \"not an opioid user\" for every respondent, it would be correct 94% of the time. That's a pretty good accuracy score! Of course, it doesn't tell us anything about what we actually want to know.\n",

This allows the computer to spin up parallel processes. This will only work if your computer has multiple cores. But if it does, it can certainly make this run faster. If your computer does not have multiple cores available, just make n_jobs = 1.\n",

Grid search will search every combination of parameters we give it, so the more parameters we include, the more models will be fit (and the longer it will take to run the code). You can review all the possible parameters and what they mean in the <a href=\"https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html?highlight=learning_rate#parameters-for-tree-booster\">documentation</a>. That's where you also find the possible range of each parameter.\n",

I've found that 2 or 3 of each parameter is enough to find a decently fitting model. After you have run this and found your best model, if any of the parameters are at the minimum or maximum of what you searched, you might want to try a lower or higher number in the range and search again.\n",
