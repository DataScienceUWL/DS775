The current practice is to replace the relays only when they fail. \n\nThe average total cost of doing this has been \\$3.19 per hour. To attempt to reduce this cost, a proposal has been made to replace all four relays whenever any one of them fails to reduce the frequency with which the control panel must be shut down.

The control panel must be shut down for one hour to replace one relay or for two hours to replace all four relays. The total cost associated with shutting down the control panel and replacing relays is \\$1,000 per hour plus \\$200 for each new relay.\n\nUse simulation on a spreadsheet to evaluate the cost of the proposal and compare it to the current practice.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c2c7da","input":"You should have noticed when running the cells above multiple times that the results vary each time the random numbers are generated.  A simulation can be reproduced exactly by specifying a random number seed so that the (pseudo-)random numbers generated will have the same initial value to start the process of random number generation.\n\nRun the following cell a few times to see if the results vary.  Change the random number seed to a different value and run the cell again.  Just pick any number you want for the seed.  Did the results change when the random number seed changed?\n\nGo back to the original seed of 5 and run the cell again.  What happens?  Do you recognize the result?

In fact, even the maximum cost per hour of the 1000 replications in the simulation is less than the \\$3.19 per hour, so clearly the policy of replacing all four relays when the any one of them fails is more cost-effective.
