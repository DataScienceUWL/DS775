After reading the textbook work your way through the lesson notebook.  If you have time, go through each example and make sure you understand the implementation and solution.  Work Self-Assessment problems to solidify your understanding (we don't collect these).  Finally, start the homework and return to the lesson as needed.\n",

    "2.  Loosely work through the lesson notebook before beginning the homework.  Your goal is developing awareness of the content and code before beginning the homework.  After developing a loose understanding of the lesson then start the homework and refer to the lesson to fill in details as needed.  This approach may be more time efficient for some students, but it's easy to fall into the trap of trying to copy and tweak code from the lesson without really understanding the code in the first place.  Tweaking code without really understanding it is inefficient and frustrating.\n",

Plans now are being made for leasing warehouse storage space over the next 5 months. Just how much space will be required in each of these months is known. However, since these space requirements are quite different, it may be most economical to lease only the amount needed each month on a month-by-month basis. On the other hand, the additional cost for leasing space for additional months is much less than for the first month, so it may be less expensive to lease the maximum amount required for the entire 5 months. Another option is the intermediate approach of changing the total amount of space leased (by adding a new lease and/or having an old lease expire) at least once but not every month.\n",
