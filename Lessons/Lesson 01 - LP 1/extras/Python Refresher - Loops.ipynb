    "## Loops Introduction\n",
    "Loops are fundamental programming concepts, and they're used extensively when we're hand-coding optimization problems. Understanding how loops work will be crucial to your ability to successfully complete your homework. Generally, we use for loops and while loops. Both are similar, but have slightly different stopping conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to understand what loops are doing is to practice using them with simple conditions, printing out your variables for each iteration of the loop. Flow diagram images in this tutorial are from https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/how-to-understand-for-and-while-loop-visually-c11052479df5\n",

    "### For Loops\n",
    "For loops are used when you have a specific number of iterations you'd like to loop. You can either loop using a static number, or you can loop over an object that is iterable (a list, a dictionary, a numpy array, a dataframe, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, a for loop looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words, for each item in a sequence, we execute some code. If at the end of the code execution, there is another item in the sequence, we go back to the top of our code block and execute again, using the next item of the sequence. Let's see how it works with looping over a numpy array of random numbers. We'll manually sum up the random numbers using a for loop.\n"

    "One final example. If what we want to do with our list comprehension is a little bit messy, we can also write a function that we use in the list comprehension. In this scenario, we want to create a new dictionary that holds the time to drive our routes. We know that, on average, people drive 70 mph on these roads (all our destinations are connected by interstates). But, if traffic is heavy, it takes approximately 10% longer to get there. We'll make a function that determines drive time and use it to generate a new dictionary of route drive times."
