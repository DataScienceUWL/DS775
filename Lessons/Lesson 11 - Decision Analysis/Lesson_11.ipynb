Because there are many videos we elected to put the Self Assessment Questions and Solutions in two separate notebooks in the same folder as this lesson notebook.  We refer to the self assessment questions by number in this notebook.  We suggest you work through this notebook and the Self Assessment Questions in parallel pausing after each video to attempt the corresponding self assessment question.

    "Decision analysis is a framework for rational decision making when the outcomes are uncertain.  We'll introduce all of the ideas in the context of a prototype example explained below.  This is the same example used in the textbook, but we'll add some different perspectives.  Read through the example to get an idea of the problem before we start discussing it.\n",

    "\n",
    "The GOFERBROKE COMPANY owns a tract of land that may contain oil. A consulting geologist has reported to management that she believes there is one chance in four of oil. Because of this prospect, another oil company has offered to purchase the land for \\$90,000. However, Goferbroke is considering holding the land in order to drill for oil itself. The cost of drilling is \\$100,000. If oil is found, the resulting expected revenue will be $800,000, so the companyâ€™s expected profit (after deducting the cost of drilling) will be \\$700,000. A loss of \\$100,000 (the drilling cost) will be incurred if the land is dry (no oil).\n",
