Let $B$ be the event that a randomly selected marble from the bag is blue and let $L$ be the event that a randomly selected marble is large.  Explain what $P(B|L)$ and $P(L|B)$ represent in words and compute both of them to show that conditional probabilities can differ when the roles of the events are reversed (that is, show that $P(B|L) \\neq P(L|B)$).\n",
