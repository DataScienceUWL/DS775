    "Recommender Systems are a complicated topic. This week's lesson and next week's lesson are intended to just give you a small taste of what recommender systems can do. To truly implement a recommender system, you'd want to dive much deeper. It's a topic worthy of more study. Recommender systems are all around you. Let's explore one recommender system you're probably familiar with, Netflix. \n",

    "This week we'll look at two types of recommenders: Knowledge-Based Recommenders and Content-Based Recommenders. These systems are both used to address the \"cold-start\" problem. The cold-start problem is the idea that when you first launch a recommender site, you probably don't have data about what a user likes or how your items have been rated by other users. This lack of data makes it difficult to return really good recommendations, as most of the best recommenders rely on having ratings data. It also makes it impossible to quantify the quality of your recommendations. If you were building recommenders like this in real life, you might want to do some user-testing to validate if your recommender system is making good suggestions. Here, we'll just rely on our own best judgement."

    "The knowledge-based recommender is just a simple ranked chart of data built using some input from the user. Banik describes it as a recommender that:\n",
    "1. Gets user input on their preferences.\n",
    "2. Extracts all the records that match the conditions set by the user.\n",
    "3. Calculates a score to sort the records.\n",
    "4. Returns the sorted results.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "Like most data science projects, preparing/wrangling/cleaning your data for your recommender system can be the hardest part. In the lessons and homework, we'll be providing you data that has already been simplified to some extent, so we can focus more on the concepts of recommender systems. For our knowledge-based recommender, we're going to be using the movies_metadata_clean.csv file in the data directory of the lesson. If you'd like to see how we got to this file from the movies_metadata.csv file used in the book, please review the \"DataCleaning\" notebook in the extras directory."

You'll need to consider the data that you're working with and decide how to calculate a meaningful score. If you are running an e-commerce site, you might use products with the highest percent off sale. If you're recommending library books, you might use a score built off of the number of times the book has been checked out, weighted by the number of weeks since it was first in circulation.\n",

Say you have a rating scale from 1 to 5 stars. Your highest average rating would be 5 - a perfect score. But does a rating of 5 by one user mean the same thing as a rating of 5 by 100 users?

    "# Content-Based Recommender\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different approaches to doing content-based recommenders. What they all share is that they use some method to:\n",
    "* select and clean text\n",
    "* convert text to a numerical representation\n",
    "* use the numerical representation of the text to assign similarity scores between each pair or set of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our pairs of items are scored, given one \"seed\" item, we can then recommend items that are similar to that item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down into steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting and Cleaning Text\n",
    "Banik talks about either using metadata or descriptions as the text that represents your item. This is a bit of a simplification. Really you could use any text, or any combination of text, that you have available to you. You should put time and effort into deciding what text you'll use. Consider which textual elements best represent the essence of the items you're recommending. Here's where that user testing comes into play. Maybe you write two recommenders - one using metadata and one using descriptions and you get your family and friends to sit down and review the recommendations that they receive using each approach. Is one better than the other? Does one recommend entirely inappropriate things? (We've all heard the stories about recommender systems gone wrong.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever text you use, you most likely want to do some pre-processing of the text first. This step is referred to as \"cleaning\" the text. There are many, many possible steps you can take here. We'll demonstrate just a few of them. Banik doesn't really discuss this bit, but we think it's too important to gloss over. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things to consider doing to your text, once you've decided which bits of text you're going to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Converting it to lowercase.\n",
    "2. Removing punctuation.\n",
    "3. Stemming or Lemmatization.\n",
    "4. Using N-grams or combining words.\n",
    "5. Identifying and using specific parts of speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entire courses have been written about natural language processing. We can't get into all the details, so we'll focus on just a few steps that you can take that integrate well with scikit learn's CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer - converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, lemmatizing (converting words to their \"root\" word), and n-grams. Remember, a CountVectorizer creates a matrix of all the words available in the text, and *counts* each occurrence of each word. Banik does a nice job explaining this so we won't delve too deeply into it here. We'll loop back to TfidfVectorizer in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting to lowercase, removing stop words, and removing punctuation.\n",
    "These are by far the easiest. The vectorizers automatically remove most punctuation. Converting to lowercase is the default setting for both of the vectorizers. And removing a standard set of stop words can be done just by adding one parameter. We'll add both parameters explicitly just so you can see what happens. First we need some data to play with. Let's set that up. Here we're creating a dataframe with three \"documents\" and setting the index of the documents to the ID column.\n"

For example, the root word for the verb \"is\" is \"be.\" Roots for nouns are generally the singular form of the word. Root forms of verbs tend to be the present-tense form. Adding lemmatization is a bit more complicated. We need to create a custom tokenizer. The tokenizer is what the vectorizers use to chunk up the text into tokens (typically single words). We'll create a tokenizer that converts the words to their lemmas (root words) before the vectorizer creates the matrix. Don't panic. We're giving you the code here. There are two bits - one cell that you'd only need once and shouldn't have to alter at all, and then the code to actually set up the vectorizer, and call the fit_transform, which would only require passing in different data."

    "Visually looking for similarities doesn't really work well for very many items. Instead, let's determine how similar each movie is to each other movie mathematically. We'll use cosine similarity to do that. Cosine similarity compares the direction of vectors in multi-dimensional space. The less angle between each vector, the higher the cosine-similarity score. What now? Yep, it's a lot to wrap your head around. Just remember that each row of our matrix can be thought of as a vector that can be plotted in multi-dimensional space. It's easier if we think about a 2 dimensional problem. Let's say we had 2 characteristics and 4 movies that we've scored based on those characteristics. If we plot those on a graph and draw a line from the origin (0,0) through their score points, we'd have a vector for each of the characteristics pointing in specific directions. Let's look at an example."

If you have data that's already normalized so that all the scores share the same magnitude, such as what happens with TfidfVectorizer (where each score is between 0 and 1), you can use the computationally cheaper dot product calculation using linear_kernel(). If you're using the CountVectorizer, you have to use the cosine similarity function - cosine_similarity() -  which will normalize your data before calculating your vector distances.  e\n",

    "We mentioned at the beginning that you could use any text you have available. But so far, we've only demonstrated using free-form text - like a description, synopsis, or overview. You can also use metadata that comes from more defined and finite lists. Banik demonstrates this with keywords and credits and we have that code for you in the Content Based Recommenders file in this directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some things consider when using the metadata to generate your list of features. First, if you have multiple metadata fields, you'll probably want to combine them. Banik calls this combined list of words the \"soup.\" I think he's thinking of alphabet soup here, since we're throwing all the words together and stirring them up. That might be fine if each of your categorical lists of words are single words. But if you have categories that include phrases, you should consider pre-processing the phrases in such a way that the spaces between your words in the phrases are removed. For instance, remembering what you've learned so far, think about what would happen if you had the following records:\n",

    "| MJ's Finest   | High Prices, Upscale |\n",
    "| Panera        | Fast Casual              |\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to vectorize the keywords as-is, we'd end up with the following words: fast, food, high, volume, prices, upscale, casual. But we'd lose the differentiation between high-volume and high-prices and fast-food and fast-casual. Banik uses \"sanitizing\" to prevent this kind of ambiguity. The sanitizing function is available in the book and in the Content Recommender chapter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also demonstrate the basic principles with our snip dataset. We already have our genres in a list and none of our snip movies have more than 3 genres and each of our genres are only 1 word. So we don't have to generate lists or sanitize anything. We simply need to create a soup of our overview and our genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: genres is a list, so we'll need to use ' '.join() to turn it into a string. Overview is a string, so we just need to add that string onto the end of the string created after ' '.join()ing the genres. Be sure to add a space in between."
