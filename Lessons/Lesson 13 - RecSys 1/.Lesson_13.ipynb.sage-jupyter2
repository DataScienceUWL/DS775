So, our red and blue movies score nearly a perfect match, even though the red movie is arguably a more comedic movie than the blue movie. That's just how these similarity measures work.\n\n### Dot Product (linear_kernel) vs. Cosine Similarity\nBanik briefly mentions this, but it bears repeating. If you have data that's already normalized so that all the scores share the same magnitude, such as what happens with TfidfVectorizer (where each score is between 0 and 1), you can use the computationally cheaper dot product calculation using linear_kernel(). If you're using the CountVectorizer, you have to use the cosine similarity function - cosine_similarity() -  which will normalize your data before calculating your vector distances.  e\n\nIf you want to dive into the math of all this, the book \"Practical Recommender Systems\" by Kim Falk does a nice job of explaining and diving much deeper into these concepts.\n\nWith our snip dataset, we've constructed our vector matrix using Tfidf, so we can use the linear_kernel()/dot product method to get our similiarity scores.","pos":67,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"30de58","input":"## Creating a metric\nKnowledge-based recommenders rely on some sort of score for returning their results. There's no right answer for what the score is or how it should be calculated. You'll need to consider the data that you're working with and decide how to calculate a meaningful score. If you are running an e-commerce site, you might use products with the highest percent off sale. If you're recommending library books, you might use a score built off of the number of times the book has been checked out, weighted by the number of weeks since it was first in circulation.\n\nFor this example, we're interested in highly-rated movies. But, it makes sense to consider both the average rating for a movie and the number of people that rated the movie. Say you have a rating scale from 1 to 5 stars. Your highest average rating would be 5 - a perfect score. But does a rating of 5 by one user mean the same thing as a rating of 5 by 100 users? Probably not.\n\nBanik solves this problem by using the IMDB weighted rating. \n\n$$Weighted Rating (WR) = \\left(\\frac{v}{v+m} * R\\right) + \\left(\\frac{m}{v+m}*C\\right)$$\n \nWhere:\n* v is the number of votes garnered by the movie\n* m is the minimum number of votes required for the movie to be in the chart (the prerequisite)\n* R is the mean rating of the movie\n* C is the mean rating of all the movies in the dataset\n\nBanik chose the 80th percentile for the minimum number of votes to be included in the recommender. \n\nNote that Banik chooses m (our minimum number of votes) based on the whole dataset, because IMDB sets this as the minimum threshold for being included in the ratings. So m is both a part of the metric AND a filter.\n\nLet's also base C on the whole dataset to start.\n\nLet's fetch C and m and filter to movies that have vote_counts greater than or equal to the 80th quantile. (This is equivalent to getting the top 20% of votes.) ","pos":14,"type":"cell"}

This week's lesson and next week's lesson are intended to just give you a small taste of what recommender systems can do. To truly implement a recommender system, you'd want to dive much deeper. It's a topic worthy of more study. Recommender systems are all around you. Let's explore one recommender system you're probably familiar with, Netflix. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0qVVRJoCf0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThis week we'll look at two types of recommenders: Knowledge-Based Recommenders and Content-Based Recommenders. These systems are both used to address the \"cold-start\" problem. The cold-start problem is the idea that when you first launch a recommender site, you probably don't have data about what a user likes or how your items have been rated by other users. This lack of data makes it difficult to return really good recommendations, as most of the best recommenders rely on having ratings data. It also makes it impossible to quantify the quality of your recommendations. If you were building recommenders like this in real life, you might want to do some user-testing to validate if your recommender system is making good suggestions. Here, we'll just rely on our own best judgement.","pos":2,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"461709","input":"By adding in n-grams, we went from 5 features to 8 features. Note that this is a very small corpus of text. If we were analyzing large bodies of text, adding in n-grams can increase your feature space very quickly. Be cautious about using n-grams if you're working with large datasets. But, if you know your text has a lot of meaningful phrases, it might be an approach worth considering, particularly if you're getting poor results from single words.\n\n#### Lemmatization\nFinally, let's look at lemmatization. Lemmatizing a word means reducing it to its root word. For example, the root word for the verb \"is\" is \"be.\" Roots for nouns are generally the singular form of the word. Root forms of verbs tend to be the present-tense form. Adding lemmatization is a bit more complicated. We need to create a custom tokenizer. The tokenizer is what the vectorizers use to chunk up the text into tokens (typically single words). We'll create a tokenizer that converts the words to their lemmas (root words) before the vectorizer creates the matrix. Don't panic. We're giving you the code here. There are two bits - one cell that you'd only need once and shouldn't have to alter at all, and then the code to actually set up the vectorizer, and call the fit_transform, which would only require passing in different data.","pos":54,"type":"cell"}

Our black arrow is the exact opposite of our red arrow, and probably represents a slow-moving, serious movie. \n\nWhen we quantify this with cosine similarity, we end up with a number for each pair of movies that's somewhere between -1 (total opposites) and 1 (exactly the same).

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"56fdb7","input":"# Content-Based Recommender\n\nThere are a number of different approaches to doing content-based recommenders. What they all share is that they use some method to:\n* select and clean text\n* convert text to a numerical representation\n* use the numerical representation of the text to assign similarity scores between each pair or set of items.\n\nOnce our pairs of items are scored, given one \"seed\" item, we can then recommend items that are similar to that item.\n\nLet's break this down into steps. \n\n## Selecting and Cleaning Text\nBanik talks about either using metadata or descriptions as the text that represents your item. This is a bit of a simplification. Really you could use any text, or any combination of text, that you have available to you. You should put time and effort into deciding what text you'll use. Consider which textual elements best represent the essence of the items you're recommending. Here's where that user testing comes into play. Maybe you write two recommenders - one using metadata and one using descriptions and you get your family and friends to sit down and review the recommendations that they receive using each approach. Is one better than the other? Does one recommend entirely inappropriate things? (We've all heard the stories about recommender systems gone wrong.)\n\nWhatever text you use, you most likely want to do some pre-processing of the text first. This step is referred to as \"cleaning\" the text. There are many, many possible steps you can take here. We'll demonstrate just a few of them. Banik doesn't really discuss this bit, but we think it's too important to gloss over. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things to consider doing to your text, once you've decided which bits of text you're going to use.\n\n1. Converting it to lowercase.\n2. Removing punctuation.\n3. Stemming or Lemmatization.\n4. Using N-grams or combining words.\n5. Identifying and using specific parts of speech.\n\nEntire courses have been written about natural language processing. We can't get into all the details, so we'll focus on just a few steps that you can take that integrate well with scikit learn's CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer - converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, lemmatizing (converting words to their \"root\" word), and n-grams. Remember, a CountVectorizer creates a matrix of all the words available in the text, and *counts* each occurrence of each word. Banik does a nice job explaining this so we won't delve too deeply into it here. We'll loop back to TfidfVectorizer in a bit.\n\n### Converting to lowercase, removing stop words, and removing punctuation.\nThese are by far the easiest. The vectorizers automatically remove most punctuation. Converting to lowercase is the default setting for both of the vectorizers. And removing a standard set of stop words can be done just by adding one parameter. We'll add both parameters explicitly just so you can see what happens. First we need some data to play with. Let's set that up. Here we're creating a dataframe with three \"documents\" and setting the index of the documents to the ID column.\n","pos":48,"type":"cell"}

We're going to do this slightly differently than Banik did. \n* We'll avoid giving it any variable defaults (which is a good practice unless you're hard-coding the defaults).\n* We'll pass in the string to identify the seed column and get the indices mapping inside the function. (The seed column is whatever column we're using to identify the item we're interested in using to recommend other items. In this case, it's a movie title. But it could be a place name, or a recipe title, or whatever, depending on our recommender.)\n* We'll also pass in the number of results to return. This is hard-coded number, so we will set a default for that.\n* We'll delete the passed-in movie explicitly, instead of assuming it's the first after sorting\n* We'll return the whole dataframe, not just the titles","pos":82,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cb2dce","input":"We mentioned at the beginning that you could use any text you have available. But so far, we've only demonstrated using free-form text - like a description, synopsis, or overview. You can also use metadata that comes from more defined and finite lists. Banik demonstrates this with keywords and credits and we have that code for you in the Content Based Recommenders file in this directory. \n\nThere are some things consider when using the metadata to generate your list of features. First, if you have multiple metadata fields, you'll probably want to combine them. Banik calls this combined list of words the \"soup.\" I think he's thinking of alphabet soup here, since we're throwing all the words together and stirring them up. That might be fine if each of your categorical lists of words are single words. But if you have categories that include phrases, you should consider pre-processing the phrases in such a way that the spaces between your words in the phrases are removed. For instance, remembering what you've learned so far, think about what would happen if you had the following records:\n\n| Business      | Keywords                 |\n| ------------- | ------------------------ |\n| McDonald's    | Fast Food, High Volume   |\n| MJ's Finest   | High Prices, Upscale |\n| Panera        | Fast Casual              |\n\nIf we were to vectorize the keywords as-is, we'd end up with the following words: fast, food, high, volume, prices, upscale, casual. But we'd lose the differentiation between high-volume and high-prices and fast-food and fast-casual. Banik uses \"sanitizing\" to prevent this kind of ambiguity. The sanitizing function is available in the book and in the Content Recommender chapter notebook.\n\nWe can also demonstrate the basic principles with our snip dataset. We already have our genres in a list and none of our snip movies have more than 3 genres and each of our genres are only 1 word. So we don't have to generate lists or sanitize anything. We simply need to create a soup of our overview and our genres.\n\nNote: genres is a list, so we'll need to use ' '.join() to turn it into a string. Overview is a string, so we just need to add that string onto the end of the string created after ' '.join()ing the genres. Be sure to add a space in between.","pos":94,"type":"cell"}
