    "#### Goals and Guidelines for Abstract Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate the data from the model.  You can type out lists or arrays with the raw data, but you should parse the coefficients into dictionaries or Pandas objects to be used in the model.  In general you should pretend that the data is being loaded into lists, dataframes, or arrays and then processed before model construction.\n",
    "* Suppose you want to write all of your constraints as \"$\\leq$\" but you have some that go the wrong direction.  For example\n",
    "$$ 3x - 2y \\geq 5.$$  If you multiply both sides by $(-1)$ it reverses the inequality to yield $$ -3x + 2y \\leq -5.$$\n",
    "* Getting all the inequality constraints in the same direction helps because the coefficients can be stored and used to construct the inequalities via a loop as we did with the Wyndor model above.\n",
    "* Going forward, you'll lose points on your homework if you type out coefficients instead of using the abstract approach introduced here.  It's more difficult, but it's essential for working with large problems.  It's also great practice toward writing reusable code.\n",

    "Web Mercantile sells many household products through an online catalog. The company needs substantial warehouse space for storing its goods. Plans now are being made for leasing warehouse storage space over the next 5 months. Just how much space will be required in each of these months is known. However, since these space requirements are quite different, it may be most economical to lease only the amount needed each month on a month-by-month basis. On the other hand, the additional cost for leasing space for additional months is much less than for the first month, so it may be less expensive to lease the maximum amount required for the entire 5 months. Another option is the intermediate approach of changing the total amount of space leased (by adding a new lease and/or having an old lease expire) at least once but not every month.\n",
