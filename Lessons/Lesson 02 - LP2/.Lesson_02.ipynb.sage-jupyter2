While it is possible to use Python sets here, we usually use Python lists because those are both iterable and subscriptable.

You can type out lists or arrays with the raw data, but you should parse the coefficients into dictionaries or Pandas objects to be used in the model.  In general you should pretend that the data is being loaded into lists, dataframes, or arrays and then processed before model construction.\n* Suppose you want to write all of your constraints as \"$\\leq$\" but you have some that go the wrong direction.  For example\n$$ 3x - 2y \\geq 5.$$  If you multiply both sides by $(-1)$ it reverses the inequality to yield $$ -3x + 2y \\leq -5.$$\n* Getting all the inequality constraints in the same direction helps because the coefficients can be stored and used to construct the inequalities via a loop as we did with the Wyndor model above.\n* Going forward, you'll lose points on your homework if you type out coefficients instead of using the abstract approach introduced here.  It's more difficult, but it's essential for working with large problems.  It's also great practice toward writing reusable code.\n* If you want additional practice, many of the self-assessment problems below include abstract formulations.\n","pos":25,"type":"cell"}

Tanner Company is a special\n  kind of toy that provides an estimated unit profit of \\$3. Because\n  of a large demand for this toy, management would like to increase\n  its production rate from the current level of 1,000 per\n  day. However, a limited supply of two subassemblies (A and B) from\n  vendors make this difficult. Each toy requires two subassemblies of\n  type A, but the vendor providing these subassemblies would only be\n  able to increase its supply rate from the current 2,000 per day to a\n  maximum of 3,000 per day. Each toy requires only one subassembly of\n  type B, but the vendor providing these subassemblies would be unable\n  to increase its supply rate above the current level of 1,000 per\n  day. Because no other vendors currently are available to provide\n  these subassemblies, management is considering initiating a new\n  production process internally that would simultaneously produce an\n  equal number of subassemblies of the two types to supplement the\n  supply from the two vendors. It is estimated that the company’s cost\n  for producing one subassembly of each type would be \\$2.50 more than\n  the cost of purchasing these subassemblies from the two\n  vendors.
