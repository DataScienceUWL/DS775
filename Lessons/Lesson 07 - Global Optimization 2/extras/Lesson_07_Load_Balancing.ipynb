    "# Load Balancing Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we're going to show how you could use various approaches to solve a load balancing problem. Load balancing is when you want to divide a workload as evenly as possible among a set of resources. If we're talking execution times on computer processors, we can describe it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "given a list of $n$ execution times, divide them to be executed on $k$ processors so that the total execution time on each processor is as close to the same as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a quick example to illustrate this. Say we had 4 jobs that needed to execute and they had the following times: [2,2,4,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had 2 servers (each with 1 processor) to divide them between, we could have one processor do [2,2] and one processor do [2,4] or we could have each processor do [2,4]. (We could also have one processor doing [2,2,4] and one doing [4], but we'll keep it simple for this example.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective function is total squared deviation of execution times from balanced time. What does that mean? Well, balanced time is when the total execution time on each processor is the same as every other processor. But, if our loads are out of balance, some processors will be doing much more work. We want to know the difference between what each processor would run if things were in balance and what they are actually running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $s$ is the sum of all execution times, and $k$ is the number of processors, determing our objective function by hand would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/startloadbalancing.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were perfectly load balanced, it would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/endloadbalancing.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into working out this same problem in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll set our times as a numpy array and we'll create an objective function that does all our calculations for us. In order for the objective function to work, we need to know how to assign each job to a processor. We'll create another numpy array that has the number of the processor to assign to, and we'll use index filtering to fetch each \"set\" of processing times. (We'll walk you through what we're talking about in the comments below.)"

    "\n",
    "When we use the simanneal package, we need to take the code that we had in our own functions before and put it inside special functions that simanneal understands. The simanneal package uses two functions - move() and energy(). These correlate with the reassign_one() and balance_metric() functions. The move function handles whatever change you're making. It's job is to make the change, and possibly to enforce constraints. (Either function can enforce constraints, depending on the method used.) The energy's job is to just return the current score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nice part about the simanneal package is that it does all your comparisons for you. You don't have to write any code to compare your current state and new state. That happens \"behind the scenes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk a little bit about \"state.\" State is the current snapshot of whatever values you're **changing**. If we said we had an assignment of job 1 to process A and job 2 to process B, the assignments are the current state not the jobs. We need the jobs to determine energy. But, the jobs don't change at all. They stay the same. So they aren't part of the state. (Even if we put job 1 and job 2 on process B, we still just have job 1 and job 2. We aren't going to suddenly have an extra job.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We still need our jobs to be available to us in the simanneal package. So we'll pass it in as another variable when we initialize the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how it's done."
