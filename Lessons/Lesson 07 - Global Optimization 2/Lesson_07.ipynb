    "Genetic algorithms are another example of metaheuristic global optimization. Think of a genetic algorithm as a smart version of random search.  Genetic algorithms are great at exploring large search spaces, but sometimes aren't so good at zeroing in on a solution once they've gotten close to a good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have read about the basics of genetic algorithms in the textbook.  Genetic algorithms are a vast subject, and we'll just scratch the surface.  Fortunately, there seem to be tons of free tutorials and other resources available for learning more about genetic algorithms.  The pseudocode for a genetic algorithm is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms are an important example of a population based algorithm.  Note that in the previous methods we've studied:  local search, simulated annealing, and Bayesian optimization, we focus on updating a single point by using historical information from previous points.  In a population based algorithm, a set of points, called a population, is iteratively updated together to progress toward an optimal point.  In a genetic algorithm, rules inspired by natural evolution are used to update the population of potential solutions.  There are also many other population based algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, and Evolution Strategies, where the latter includes genetic algorithms.  Genetic algorithms are a very flexible and popular population based method that can work over many problems and variable types.  <a href=\"https://bdataanalytics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41044-016-0003-3\">Here is a survey</a> of population based optimization algorithms in data science if you'd like to explore further on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Genetic Algorithm Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to use genetic algorithms in practice, it's probably better to seek out a package that has that functionality.  Some options include:\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://github.com/deap/deap\" target=\"_blank\">The `DEAP` package</a>.  This package is for genetic programming.  It's very powerful and flexible, but also abstract with a significant learning curve.  It's worth learning if you often need to use genetic algorithms or other types of evolutionary algorithms.\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/geneticalgorithm/\" target=\"_blank\">The `geneticalgorithm` package</a> This package is an easy to use, but limited, genetic algorithm for minimization.  It supports either real or integer variables.  It can't be used for problems with permutations such as TSP.  Also, the objective function can have only one argument so if you need additional data (e.g. the distance matrix) the function will have to find the data in the global scope.  It's slow with the default settings.\n",
    "* The `deap_wrapper` package.  This is something we've been working on but at the moment it's not a well documented package.  If you're curious, you can see examples of how to use it in the notebook `deap_wrapper_examples.ipynb` in the same folder as this lesson.\n",
    "* The `GA` package in R.  This is a really easy to use implementation of the genetic algorithms that handles several types of variables.  Documentation is <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GA/\" target=\"_blank\">here on CRAN</a>.  In our experience this is a lot easier to use than `DEAP`.  The notebook `Genetic_Algorithm_with_R.ipynb` gives an example and shows how you can include R in a Python Jupyter notebook (it's pretty cool).\n",

Unlike in real breeding, our population size will remain constant, so our selected individuals will replace the initial individuals in the population.

The number of individuals in each subset is called the tournament size.  The larger the size of the tournament, the more likely that only the fittest members of the population are selected for the next generation.  Small tournament sizes mean that less fit individuals have a chance to be selected.  We'll use a `tourn_size = 2`.  You can read a bit about other selection operators in any genetic algorithms textbook.

The idea is to sample uniformly from an interval that includes $x_i$ and $y_i$ but is expanded by, for example 20%, in each direction.  The exact amount of expansion is determined by the parameter $\\alpha$ which is usually between 0 and 1.  Values of $\\alpha$ are typically around 0.1 or 0.2.  \n",

In the cell below we have the code for creating the values of 1000 items and also the fitness function we're trying to minimize.  Mimic the genetic algorithm from above to minimize the differences in the total values \n",

    "* The initial population should be individuals of length 1000 (`tot_num_items`) each having integer values between 0 and 3 with repeats allowed (there are `num_groups = 4` box cars to sort items into).  Use `numpy.random.randint`\n",
    "* You can use onePointCrossover to mate individuals.  That part of the code doesn't need to change at all.  \n",
    "* Use the uniformIntMutation() for mutation.\n",
    "* Pay attention to the order of parameters in your objective function. Note that our algorithm expects the X values first, and any other parameters can be passed in as named variables.\n",
    "* The objective function is `group_fitness` and is provided below for convenience along with code to generate a set of values that can be perfectly balanced for testing.\n",
    "* Consider reducing the tot_num_items for testing your algorithm so the code runs faster.  Remember to push it back to 1000 for your final runs.\n",
    "* Experiment with the algorithm parameters.  Can you find parameters that routinely achieve minimum fitness $\\leq 20.$"
